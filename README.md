# MacintoshKeyboardRemapper

This is an Arduino project which allows to customize Macintosh 128k/512k/Plus M0110 keyboard layout. Currently I have remapped some of the international layout keyboard keys to match their equivalents in english versions of early Macintosh System.

Custom Eagle board and schematics have been added in case you wanted to assemble the dedicated device. There is also a simple case available for 3D printing on [tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/eFeMwL3gJX1-mackeyboardremapperbox).
